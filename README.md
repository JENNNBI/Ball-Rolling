# Ball-Rolling
We can control the player with a RayCast. When player touched the points, player will be biggger and faster. That was the mechanic i was try to do and at some point i did it!

In the game, there will be obstacle that make player stop and lose point when they collide.
If player collide with the obstacle there will be consequence which is player logicly gonna move slow and  it will be smaller.
