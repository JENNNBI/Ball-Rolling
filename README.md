# Ball-Rolling
We can control the player with a RayCast. When player touched the points, player will be biggger and faster. That was the mechanic i was try to do and at some point i did it!

In the game, there will be obstacle that make player stop and lose point when they collide.
If player collide with the obstacle there will be consequence which is player logicly gonna move slow and  it will be smaller.

As you can see i didn't set the score while we collecting points. Its a another time!

At the end of level 1 there is a melting area that i call. Basically player's ball dissapering fast (melting). This is a simple mechanic
i try to accomplish. You can reach me and fix the thing that i make mistake or teach better adjustment/ technic.
