# Ball-Rolling
We can control the player with a RayCast. When player touched the points, player will be biggger and faster. That was the mechanic i was try to do and at some point i did it!

In the game, there will be an obstacle that makes the player stop and lose points when they collide. If the player collides with the obstacle,the pace of the ball will slow down as the ball will reduce in size.

As you can see i didn't set the score while we collecting points. Its a another time!

At the end of level 1 there is a melting area that i call which player can't cross. Basically player's ball dissapering fast (melting). This is a simple mechanic
i try to accomplish. You can reach me and fix the things that i made mistake or teach me for better adjustment/ technic.
